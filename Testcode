Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a Senior Embedded & IoT Software Engineer with over 9 years of R&D-driven experience developing Linux-based embedded systems and multi-layer connected platforms across medical, automotive, industrial, and public infrastructure domains. My background spans full product lifecycles, from board bring-up and BSP customization to secure communication, OTA firmware upgrades, and field-deployed diagnostic tools in regulated environments.

In my recent roles, I have led firmware integration across multi-board architectures, designed secure MCU–SOM communication pipelines, and developed Android- and Qt-based diagnostic and provisioning tools supporting production validation and remote servicing. I have worked extensively with STM32 and NXP i.MX platforms, CAN/I2C/SPI/UART/MQTT communication stacks, and Yocto-based build systems, while adhering to stringent quality and safety standards including IEC 62304 and MISRA-C/C++ compliance.

I am currently based in Bangalore, India, and am actively seeking opportunities across Europe, with a strong motivation for long-term relocation and contribution to product-focused engineering teams. I am particularly interested in roles where deep embedded expertise, system-level ownership, and cross-domain problem-solving are valued. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support your organization’s engineering goals.

Kind regards,
