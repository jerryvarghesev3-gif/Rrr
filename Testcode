Hi Jean,

I hope you’re doing well.

I have a doubt regarding the screen-resolution scaling standard followed by the Accella service tool technicians.
As I’m seeing in the old Accella service tool code (master), the top margins, text paddings, and anchor values are pointing to fixed numbers (10, 20 etc.).

If I’m not wrong, there should be some standard values followed in the service tool for screen scaling, because alignment will not work reliably with fixed values on different systems.

I fixed the screen-resolution issues like I fixed the screen padding in the report panel. When the panel is resized manually, window width works fine because alignment happens based on pixel density dynamically. But in the case of screen padding, the app works fine at 100% and 125% DPI, but at 150% DPI the alignment breaks.


understand what the standard screen-resolution / DPI scaling recommendation is for the service app (100%, 125%, or 150%)?

Right now, screen scaling is done by OS DPI changes. We cannot make it dynamic inside the app, so we need to follow a standard DPI scaling to avoid alignment issues. For example, on an 800× laptop, 150% scaling is recommended, but in that case the text and app density changes and alignment breaks. That’s why we need clarity on the standard DPI scaling expected for this app.

Thanks,
