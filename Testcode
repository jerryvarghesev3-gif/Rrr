Hi Boris,

Soumya has identified an issue in the existing released version 1.1.6 (refer to the newly created Ticket 9).
We also have a few open points in this ticket, which we can discuss further during the call.

A new issue has been found in the existing software, and since this area is new for us, we will need some additional guidance to debug it correctly. Jeudy has been helping us already, so his inputs during the call would be very helpful.
Remoleur, it would be great if we could review the release plan together as well.

Please let me know if this time works for you, or feel free to suggest another time based on your availability.

Regards,
Jerry
