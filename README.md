Dear Hiring Team,

I am a Senior Embedded / C++ Software Engineer with 7.5+ years of experience working on performance-critical systems using modern C++ (C++14/17), Embedded Linux, Yocto, BSP and low-level system integration.

I have worked across the full product lifecycle, from low-level firmware and device interaction up to system integration, testing and deployment, particularly in complex embedded and IoT environments.

I am highly motivated to relocate to Switzerland and am open to employer-sponsored work permits. I am currently learning German and plan to reach B2 level, while being fully fluent in English for professional communication.

I believe my system-level mindset, strong C++ background and experience with real-world embedded products align well with PXL Vision’s work in high-quality imaging and vision systems.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Jerry Varghese











I am currently based in India and fully willing to relocate to Zurich.
I am available to start from April 2026 and am open to supporting the visa
and relocation process.

I bring strong experience in embedded C++ and Linux development, working close
to hardware and collaborating with FPGA and hardware teams.
I am particularly motivated by Zurich Instruments’ advanced R&D work
in high-performance measurement systems.

I am actively learning German and plan to complete B2 certification in 2026.
