Skills – “Describe your competence and the type of work it is suitable for”



I am a Senior Embedded & IoT Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience developing Linux-based embedded systems and multi-board architectures. My core expertise includes C/C++, embedded Linux (Yocto, Debian), STM32 and NXP i.MX platforms, board bring-up, BSP customization, and MCU–SOM communication.

I have strong experience in system-level firmware development, device drivers, middleware integration, and secure communication using CAN, SPI, I2C, UART, MQTT, and TCP/IP. I have also built Qt and Android-based diagnostic and provisioning tools, supporting production validation and field servicing in regulated environments such as medical, automotive, and industrial systems.

My skills are best suited for senior embedded software roles involving system architecture, low-level development, cross-platform tooling, and end-to-end product lifecycle ownership.








Job preferences – “What type of job are you looking for?”


I am looking for Senior Embedded Software Engineer or Senior Embedded Systems Engineer roles focused on developing Linux-based embedded products. I am particularly interested in roles involving system-level design, firmware development, hardware–software integration, and communication-heavy embedded systems.

I prefer product-oriented environments where engineers own features end-to-end, from design and implementation to testing and deployment. I am open to roles in medical devices, industrial automation, automotive, IoT, and high-reliability embedded systems.

I am seeking opportunities in Europe and am open to relocation for the right long-term, product-focused role.
