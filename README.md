1️⃣ “Why would you be good for this position?” — what to write

You should not leave this empty.
Also, don’t paste your full cover letter — keep it concise, role-focused, and confident.

Here is a ready-to-paste answer (well within 2000 characters, European tone, not arrogant):

I bring over 9 years of hands-on experience developing embedded and IoT software for safety-critical and regulated products across medical, industrial, and automotive domains. My background spans the full product lifecycle—from board bring-up and BSP customization to application development, system integration, testing, and field deployment.

I have worked extensively with STM32 and NXP i.MX platforms, Linux (Yocto/Debian), and modern C/C++ systems, designing reliable MCU–SoM communication, secure firmware update mechanisms, and diagnostic and provisioning tools used in production environments. I am comfortable working close to hardware while also collaborating across software, QA, and system teams.

In my recent roles, I have taken ownership of complex subsystems, contributed to architectural decisions, and delivered production-ready solutions under quality and compliance constraints such as IEC 62304 and MISRA-C/C++. I value clean design, maintainable code, and practical problem-solving, and I adapt quickly to new domains and teams.

I believe this combination of deep embedded expertise, system-level ownership, and experience delivering real-world products makes me a strong fit for this position.
