I am a Senior Embedded & IoT Engineer with 7.5+ years of experience in 
embedded software development using C/C++, Embedded Linux (Yocto), 
MCU–SoC based systems, BSP and device driver development.

I have hands-on experience with communication protocols such as 
CAN, SPI, I2C, UART, TCP/IP and MQTT, and have worked across the full 
product lifecycle from low-level firmware to system integration and testing.

I am actively preparing for relocation to Europe and am currently 
pursuing German language certification. I am available to start from 
April 2026 and am open to visa sponsorship and relocation.
