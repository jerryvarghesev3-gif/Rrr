I am a Senior Embedded & IoT Engineer with 7.5+ years of hands-on experience in embedded software development using C/C++ and Embedded Linux (Yocto). I have strong expertise in MCU–SoC based systems, BSP bring-up, device driver development, and low-level firmware. I have worked extensively with communication protocols such as CAN, SPI, I2C, UART, TCP/IP, and MQTT. I have experience across the full product lifecycle—from architecture and development to system integration, testing, and production support—particularly in regulated and quality-critical environments. I am highly motivated to contribute my technical expertise in an international engineering team.
