Skills – Professional Competence

I am a Senior Embedded & IoT Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience developing Linux-based embedded systems and multi-board architectures across medical, industrial, automotive, and safety-critical domains. My core expertise includes C/C++, embedded Linux (Yocto, Debian, Ubuntu), STM32 (F4/G4/H7), and NXP i.MX6 / i.MX7 SoCs, with strong hands-on experience in board bring-up, BSP customization, bootloader integration, and device-tree configuration.

I have deep experience in system-level firmware development, low-level drivers, middleware integration, and secure communication using CAN, SPI, I2C, UART, MQTT, RPC, TCP/IP, SFTP, and MCU–SoM communication. I have also worked with D-Bus and SOME/IP–based client–server architectures in Linux environments.

On the application side, I have developed cross-platform tools using Qt/QML (C++ hybrid UI), Android (Kotlin), JNI integration, and Qt-based diagnostic, provisioning, and OTA solutions supporting production validation and field servicing. I am experienced with build systems and development environments including CMake, Make, cross-compilation workflows, ARM GCC, Yocto SDKs, Keil MDK, Docker, and Linux/Windows toolchains.

I follow strong engineering practices using Git, Gerrit, SVN, Perforce, Jira, Confluence, IBM DOORS, Polarion, and static analysis tools such as Coverity. I am comfortable with hardware-level debugging using JTAG, logic analyzers, and system tracing tools, and I work in compliance-driven environments aligned with European and international quality and safety standards.

My skills are best suited for senior embedded software roles involving system architecture, low-level development, cross-platform tooling, communication-heavy embedded systems, and end-to-end product lifecycle ownership.
